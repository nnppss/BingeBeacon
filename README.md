### Plan

## Backend (Go)

A Go backend is being built to power BingeBeacon’s TV/Movie alert system.

It will handle:
- Creating/managing show/movie alerts
- Timeline updates for new episodes/seasons
- Metadata + episode tracking via OMDB, TMDB, and TheTVDB
- Notifications for tracked shows (new episodes/seasons, favorites)

**Note:** Database persistence is currently **TODO** and will be added later.
